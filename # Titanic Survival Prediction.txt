# Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on the well-known Titanic dataset and analyzes various passenger features to estimate survival probability.



## 🎯 Problem Statement
Given passenger details such as age, gender, class, and fare, the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.



## 📊 Dataset
1. **Source:** Titanic Dataset
2.**Features include:**
3. Passenger Class (Pclass)
4. Sex
5. Age
6. Fare
7. Number of siblings/spouses aboard
8. Number of parents/children aboard
9. **Target Variable:** Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)



## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Pandas
4.  NumPy
5.  Matplotlib / Seaborn
6. Scikit-learn



## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Feature selection and transformation  
4. Model training  
5. Model evaluation  



## 📈 Model Used
- Linear Regression *(Simplest way)* 
*(It Can be further extended to Logistic Regression / Random Forest for better classification performance)*

---

## ✅ Results
1. The model successfully learns patterns from passenger data.
2. Survival predictions are generated based on input features.
3. Performance metrics help evaluate model effectiveness.
